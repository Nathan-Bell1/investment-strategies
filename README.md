# learn-strategic-investing
I utilized resources and Jupyter notebooks from the non-profit organization freeCodeCamp to build three of my own working Python Pandas quantitaive investment strategy programs that displayed well-formatted results to an Excel spreadsheet.

Throughout this project, I furthered my appiled knowledge in Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, data scraping (using Yahoo Finance), Excel, and financial literacy.

In the first notebook I filtered the top fifty S&P 500 stocks, calculating the number of shares to buy of each with a set portfilio size. 
In the second notebook I expanded on the first and scored and sorted each S&P stock by its trailing momentum over a combination of 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
In the last notebook I expanded moreso and scored and sorted each stock by 5 metrics: Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Price-to-Sales (P/S), Price-to-Book (P/B), EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value to EBITDA), and EV/GP (Enterprise Value to Gross Profit).
