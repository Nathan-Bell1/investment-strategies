# learn-strategic-investing
I utilized resources and Jupyter notebooks from the non-profit organization freeCodeCamp to build 3 of my own working Python Pandas quantitaive investment strategy programs that displayed well-formatted results to an Excel spreadsheet. Throughout this project, I furthered my appiled knowledge in Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, data scraping (using Yahoo Finance), Excel, and financial literacy.

In the first notebook (Equal_Weight_Strategy), I filtered the top 50 S&P 500 stocks, calculating the number of shares to buy of each with a set portfilio size. 

In the second notebook (Quantitative_Mommentum_Strategy), I expanded on the first and scored and sorted each S&P stock by its trailing momentum over a combination of 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

In the last notebook (Quantitative_Value_Strategy), I expanded moreso, scoring and sorting each stock by 5 metrics: Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Price-to-Sales (P/S), Price-to-Book (P/B), EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value to EBITDA), and EV/GP (Enterprise Value to Gross Profit).
